## Googlemaps

- Requested: ✅
- Downloaded: 
- What I found: I was able to review my map activity online and what surprised me the most is the ability to recognize the means of transportation that I used. Also the funny ways that it names your days as in a teenage diary. For example, it says "Tardecita en Parque Bicentenario" which translates directly to "little afternoon" as a cute one. 

## Uber

- Requested:  ✅
- Downloaded:  ✅
- What I found: I was aiming for my previous uber data which I used a lot and was very curious about, but I could only download the one from my US phone. The total amount I spent in this semester was lower than I expected. Mostly because I took mostly Uber pools, which I've never used before. 


## Amazon
- Requested:  ✅
- Downloaded: ✅
- What I found: The data collecting of this site might only work here in the US, because it only shows 6 orders in a full year time. Which I don't believe is accurate. So the data is not very interesting sincce I kind of remembered the things I've ordered.
