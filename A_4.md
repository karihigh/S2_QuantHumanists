As I was testing the selfie app in my computer, I realized I barely use my computer's webcam. Even though selfies began with usb webcams attached to the computer, the smartphone was the big selfie boom. The possibility to take your picture in front of the club's mirror to showcase your look became a very common act among young people. So popular, that smartphone manufacturers added a camera in the front part of the phone so you could actually see your duck face while doing it and make sure you were looking hot af.

Taking pictures has now become a daily activity for pretty much everyone who owns a smartphone. There is a permanent urge to record the world around you, whether that includes your face or not. Social media platforms encourages this action by building a digital community that 'asks' to keep your life posted. Self promotion is a very relevant task nowadays, specially in the creative communities. I always recall Andy Warhol's famous quote "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes" which we are getting closer at a vertiginous speed.

Back to the act of taking a selfie with my laptop in 2019, made me wonder about my relationship with it. It has become a part of me, an extension of my abilities and my primary source of knowledge and entertainment. It is probably the item that knows me best, it watches and listens to me at least 8 hours a day. It records my writing, therefore my thoughts and concerns. It reads and sees everything I see. This wasn't a problem at all some years ago, but since the internet has become more powerful we are sort of afraid of our machines. They aren't going to bite or kill us (for now), but the people behind the information that we provide them might do.

Sadly the misuse of our information has already lead to the violation of human rights in many ways. So now we must be aware of what we do and say with our personal connected devices. But even the idea of getting rid completely of them scares us most. How could I ever finish my master degree without my computer? How would I communicate with my family and friends without my smartphone? And that is just the beginning of the list of things that you cannot do anymore without a connected device.

This sounds sad and seems to have no easy solution. So for now, I will try to keep a good relationship with my devices, to take care of them as they take care of me. I developed this app to make a tiny ritual for every time I start using my computer in a day and to say thank you when I finished using my \n#1 tool. I designed the app in such way that it feels like the computer is asking me to do this task for it by speaking to me.

I usually associate the use of the computer with the feeling of being inspired and ready to make the most of its capabilities. So when I take my selfie, I record in a scale from 1 to 5 my level of inspiration of the time. My inspiration is generally affected by many other parameters such as happiness, energy, sleepiness, among others. So I thought it could be a good way of attaching a feeling to a picture.
