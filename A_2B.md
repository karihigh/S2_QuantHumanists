## Dear Data
### Reflection

During this week of data tracking I definitely payed improved my ability to **pay attention**, in this case to the the ambient city noise. I would recommend this activity to Rob Walker's list. I've been always very attentive and sensitive to sound, and this week was a proof that even that characteristic maybe wasn't enough to gather all the data that I wanted. Mostly because it is very difficult to pay attention to something that you are not used to, or it doesn't feel officially relevant. I felt quite identified with Walker's article, we are now dealing with the most overwhelming time due to the amount of stimuli. It is very difficult to focus on one thing at once without being immediately disturbed by a small vibration of your pocket.

Even though I decided not to collect *personal* data, I ended up realizing that what I collected says a lot about me. My wake up and bed times, my location, my level of attention and if I was indoor or outdoors. With information that has 'nothing to do with me' I could recognize a routine. This made me reflect on how data is supposed to be accurate and how that makes it so powerful for arguments. But almost every information collected is somehow influenced by the person behind. It makes me thinks there is no way that data is free of human intervention. Even if it's collected by a mechanized system, it will always be influenced somehow.
