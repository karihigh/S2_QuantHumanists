### Dear Data
## Reflection

During this week of data tracking I definitely payed more attention to the sounds of the city. I would recommend to track the noises of your surroundings to Rob Walker's list. I've been always very attentive and sensitive to sound, and this week was a proof that even that characteristic maybe wasn't enough to gather all the data I wanted. Mostly because it is very difficult to pay attention to something that you are not used to. I felt quite reflected on Walker's article, we are now dealing with the most overwhelming time where stimuli is everywhere we look. It is very difficult to focus on one thing at once without being immediately disturbed by a small vibration of your pocket.

Even though I decided not to collect personal data, I ended up realizing that what I collected has a lot to do with me. 

short paragraph or phrase on what you learned this week while doing this Dear Data Exercise + any thoughts about how your self-tracking ideas might be refined as you gain more exposure to the discussions about self-tracking.
