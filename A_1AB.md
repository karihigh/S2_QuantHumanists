## Assignment 1: SELF-TRACKING DATA SCULPTURES
 
Lastly I've been curious about data sculptures that are getting more and more common among the ways to visualize data. I define a data sculpture as any three-dimensional data visualization, that takes advantage of it's dimensional characteristics. For this review, I will analyse what I believe are good data sculptures. If a work of data visualization could've been done in a poster or on the screen and had the exact same outcomes in the public, then it's considered as bad. On the contrary, a good data sculpture, would be the one that wouldn't work the same as if was a two-dimensional object.

### Stress Necklace

The data used to make this object is a daily record of anxiety and stress situations during the day, collected over a month. The person defined a scale to record each event in which they felt anxious and/or stressed. Along with this number, they collected the context in which these feelings arose. Thinking on which parts of the body get affected because of this reasons the object wanted to transfer these feelings to the public. The result is a necklace made out of rings of acrylic. Each of them represent the most stressfull days color coded according to the reasons collected. In addition, the outer diameter of each ring was bigger or smaller according to the initial scale defined. To read the data, the person must put each ring one by one until it reaches all of them. By putting each piece in the neck, the feeling of short breath increased. By the end, the person could also feel pressure in their neck, shoulders and chest. I thought this project eas very efffective in its way to transfer the information collected into an actual feeling on the audience.
