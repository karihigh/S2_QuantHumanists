### Quantified Self Final Project Proposal
#### To digitally die

I have always been I little bit skeptical about self-data tracking. When I first heard about it I felt it was a very obsessive practice to count every something in your life. Then smartphone came along with wearables that are able to track and gather conclusions without even asking the user if they want to. Suddenly you start getting notifications on your phone asking to confirm if you really had just walked 14 minutes. Is that making unconsciously want to walk more to achieve a certain goal? Or you already knew that you are mostly sedentary? Do you need a daily reminder of the life you already have? Now that I have been exposed to more methods, tools and research about the Quantified Self, I still believe there is a certain bias on the generated data. Your own feelings about yourself are the most valuable ones in the end, no one knows you better than you.

I'm not saying that tracking some aspect of your life can't be a benefit. It certainly does, but to what extent do we quantify ourselves? How is this affecting the way we get to know ourselves? How is it influencing our decisions to have a quantitative copy of something? Is it helping or it's just making us obsessively aware of that something that is being tracked? Are those benefits enough to 'pay the price' of having more data available online exposed?

The urge to survive is inherent to any human being, thus medical advance has lead to the increase of human longevity. Nowadays some can easily reach one hundred years of life, and those extreme cases are thoroughly studied in order to know what did that person through their lives in order to blow the 100 birthday candle. They had wine every of their lives, they where great hitchhikers, they worked a lot, they didn't work at all, they practiced yoga and meditate, they traveled, they found love, and so on. Fashions on what to do or not do are constantly changing. Specially in these times when connectivity allow us to have information on almost anything we can imagine.

The increased access to knowledge and technology improvements got us here, where your watch can help you reach a healthy happy 100th birthday. But also, death comes sometimes unexpected. Even the most healthy active person on your social media can die at any moment. [WeCroak](https://www.wecroak.com/) app reminds us about this fact 5 times a day in order find happiness as they put it. How do we defeat death? We can't, but there are some ways to keep us alive. Following the saying: "Write a book, plant a tree, raise a child", there is human urge to transcend. All of these actions are ways of leaving an immortal footprint behind so that we will be remembered. One does not die if there are living people that can [remember you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgmgZmTMxms). 


So all of these ways of pursuing healthy happiness by measuring aspects of our life connects back with the fact that humans use intelligence and consciousness of this to expand their capabilities. And this is usually done by external means. Want to reach something high? Build ladders. Want to travel faster? Build planes. Want to think faster? Synthesize Adderall.

Reasons why you might want to erase yourself from the internet: online abuse, cyber attacks, bank frauds, identity theft, identity change.
What if you die?
