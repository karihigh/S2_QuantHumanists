### Quantified Self Final Project Proposal
#### To digitally die

**Background research**
I have always been I little bit skeptical about self-data tracking. When I first heard about it I felt it was a very obsessive practice to count every something in your life. Then smartphone came along with wearables that are able to track and gather conclusions without even asking the user if they want to. Suddenly you start getting notifications on your phone asking to confirm if you really had just walked 14 minutes. Is that making unconsciously want to walk more to achieve a certain goal? Or you already knew that you are mostly sedentary? Do you need a daily reminder of the life you already have? Now that I have been exposed to more methods, tools and research about the Quantified Self, I still believe there is a certain bias on the generated data. Your own feelings about yourself are the most valuable ones in the end, no one knows you better than you.

I'm not saying that tracking some aspect of your life can't be a benefit. It certainly does, but to what extent do we quantify ourselves? How is this affecting the way we get to know ourselves? How is it influencing our decisions to have a quantitative copy of something? Is it helping or it's just making us obsessively aware of that something that is being tracked? Are those benefits enough to 'pay the price' of having more data available online exposed?

The urge to survive is inherent to any human being, thus medical advance has lead to the increase of human longevity. Nowadays some can easily reach one hundred years of life, and those extreme cases are thoroughly studied in order to know what did that person through their lives in order to blow the 100 birthday candle. They had wine every of their lives, they where great hitchhikers, they worked a lot, they didn't work at all, they practiced yoga and meditate, they traveled, they found love, and so on. Fashions on what to do or not do are constantly changing. Specially in these times when connectivity allow us to have information on almost anything we can imagine.

The increased access to knowledge and technology improvements got us here, where your watch can help you reach a healthy happy 100th birthday. But also, death comes sometimes unexpected. Even the most healthy active person on your social media can die at any moment. [WeCroak](https://www.wecroak.com/) app reminds us about this fact 5 times a day in order find happiness as they put it. How do we defeat death? We can't, but there are some ways to keep us alive. Following the saying: "Write a book, plant a tree, raise a child", there is human urge to transcend. All of these actions are ways of leaving an immortal footprint behind so that we will be remembered. One does not die if there are still living people that can [remember you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgmgZmTMxms).

Memory is fragile, but digital storage is not. A hard disk cannot forget. Unless it is physically destroyed, it is very difficult to permanently delete 0s and 1s. This is a great feature that has lead to many amazing things for society. But what if you want to delete it? In this age of documenting and tracking many aspects of our lives in an invisible way, it is difficult to imagine that our data is physically stored somewhere. The idea of the cloud really feels like a light puffy cloud because we never have to deal with it and people might never imagine that things are actually stored somewhere.

I had the unfortunately chance to experience a Facebook profile of a person who passed away. Before the family could have a chance to take care of all of that minor things and maybe delete the social profile of that person, his feed turned into a sort of shrine where friends and family would post their feelings for "him". First I was very shocked about seeing this, and immediately rejected the idea of doing that. So unnatural and cold and frugal. But this is the same uncomfortable feeling that someone can experience toward death. Even the thought about it makes us feel weird, scared, disgusted and we generally don't want to talk about it. We don't even want to think about the death of our love ones. We can sometimes be selfish when trying to preserve someone's life. See [Uninvited Guests](https://vimeo.com/128873380).

This is easily seen among pet owners. Animals have the great advantage to have their caretakers decide if they should keep living. 



Doing these research led me to question our rights

**Hypothesis**
It is impossible to completely delete ourselves from the internet.

**Objective**
A service that can fulfill the Right to be [Forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten).

**Goals**
Raise the question of our agency upon deciding to live or not.
