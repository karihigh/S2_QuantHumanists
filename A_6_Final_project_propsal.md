### Quantified Self Final Project Proposal
#### To digitally die

**Background research**

I have always been skeptical about self-data tracking. When I first heard about it I felt it was a very obsessive practice to count some aspect of your life in a daily basis. Then smartphones came along with wearables that are able to track and gather conclusions without even asking the user if they want to. Suddenly you start getting notifications on your phone asking to confirm if you just walked for 14 minutes. Is that making us unconsciously want to walk more to achieve a certain goal? Or you already knew that you are mostly sedentary? Do you need a daily reminder of the life you already have? Now that I have been exposed to more methods, tools and research about the Quantified Self, I still believe that there is a certain bias on the data we generate. Your personal feelings about yourself are the most valuable ones in the end. No one knows you better than yourself.

I'm not saying that tracking some aspect of your life can't be a benefit. It certainly does, but to what extent do we quantify ourselves? How is this affecting the way we get to know ourselves? How is it influencing our decisions to have a quantitative copy of an aspect of our lives? Is it helping or is it just making us obsessively aware of what is being tracked? Are those benefits enough to 'pay the price' of exposing more data available online?

The urge to survive is inherent to any human being, thus medical advance has lead to the increase of life expectancy. Nowadays some can easily reach a hundred years of life, and those cases are thoroughly studied in order to imitate any special aspect of that person's life in order to blow the 100 birthday candle. They had wine every of their lives, they went for a jog every morning, they didn't work out at all, they practiced yoga and meditate, they traveled, they found love, and so on. Fashions on what to do or not to do are constantly changing. Specially in these times when connectivity allow us to access more information than never before.

The increased access to knowledge and technology improvements got us here, were your watch can help you reach a healthy happy 100th birthday. But also, death can come at any time. Even the most healthy active person on your social media can be involved in an accident or have an unexpected heart attack. [WeCroak](https://www.wecroak.com/) app reminds us about this fact 5 times a day in order to find happiness, as they put it. How do we defeat death? We can't, but there are some ways to keep us alive by other means. A good example of this is the traditional saying: "Write a book, plant a tree, raise a child". All of these actions are ways of leaving an immortal footprint behind so that can be remembered even when dead. One can transcend if there are living people that can still [remember you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgmgZmTMxms).

Memory is fragile, but digital storage is not. A hard disk cannot forget. Unless it is physically destroyed, it is very difficult to permanently delete 0s and 1s. This is a great feature about technology that has lead to many amazing things for progress. But what if there is a reason for you to delete a digital memory? In this age of documenting and tracking many aspects of our lives in an invisible way. The idea of the cloud really feels like a light and puffy cloud because we never have to deal with it and it is difficult to imagine that our data is physically stored somewhere.

Going back to the idea to transcend beyond death, it is a particular desire of the human species. There is no proof that animals have an obsession for living or tracking some aspect of their lives to extend their life expectancy. When cats and dogs are sick and about to die they usually hide. Maybe this is the reason why pet euthanasia is legal and culturally accepted. But when it comes to humans, there are a few cases of people that had decide to voluntarily end their lives. This is called voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide and it is only legal in 1 or 2 countries in the world. Mainly because it violates the Right to Live. But what about the Right to Die? What if you don't want to live the rest of your life in pain or with a very limiting illness?

##### How does the Right to Die operates on the digital layer?

I had the unfortunate chance to experience a Facebook profile of a person who passed away. Before the family could have a chance even think about the person's online presence, his feed turned into a sort of shrine where friends and family would post their feelings and messages for "him" and/or the family. First I was very shocked about seeing this, it felt very unnatural, cold and frugal. Death is uncomfortable. Even the thought about it makes us feel weird, scared, disgusted and we generally avoid talking about it. Preserving our own or our loved ones lives could be so important that we can sometimes be selfish when trying to preserve someone's life. See [Uninvited Guests](https://vimeo.com/128873380).

There are many reasons why we could want to be deleted from the internet. Identity theft, cyber attacks, identity change, bank frauds, and possibly the most common one: death. The Right to Die has been discussed hand in hand with the Right to be Forgotten. Should we have the right to ask for personal records to be deleted from the internet? Digital laws are certainly a new thing and not so much time has passed since the digital presence could be a problem. [See Mario Costeja's case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Spain_v_AEPD_and_Mario_Costeja_Gonz√°lez). I would like to rise all of these thoughts by designing a service that could get as closer to exercise of the Right to be Forgotten and open the discussion about the moral consequences of it. This Right competes directly with the Right of Freedom. What if Hitler decides to be forgotten? Would've that been morally correct?

**Hypothesis**

It is impossible to completely delete ourselves from the internet.

**Objective**

A service that can fulfill the Right to be [Forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten).

**Goals**

Raise the question of our agency upon deciding to live or not.
