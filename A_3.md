## MY DATA FEELINGS
### Sleeplings

I have been having trouble sleeping for the last couple of months, and I wanted to start tracking some aspects of my sleep. Having mentioned before my first attempt to track my data wasn't very useful because I had to sleep with my phone under by pillow which is clearly not a good idea.

What I have been using lately is a web app called [Sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/) that calculates the time and the sleep cycles, so you can plan ahead to try to wake up after one of the cycles are finished and not in between. Inspired by this app, I am trying to try if the calculator is a good way of improving my sleep.

So thinking on a more manual way of doing it I decided to make these visualizations that can compare between 2 pairs of parameters. The first pair is the amount of hours vs the productivity. These can be seen in a vertical bar in which the amount of hours lays behind the productivity to see the resulting rectangles on the top and bottom of the bar. If they match, then more sleep is equivalent to a lot of productivity.

In the horizontal axis there is a bar that compares the morning event of waking up. With the theory that waking up in the middle of the cycle makes you sleepier during the day and vice versa, I want to compare these two factors. Also I have read how bad is to snooze the alarm multiple times. Without any real data, I feel that the mornings that I snooze
the alarm several times, it is harder to put my feet out of the bed, compared to the times I open my eyes just before the alarm or turn it off immediately as I stand up. To see how many days I achieve this, the background color of each visualization tells me if I woke up with the set alarm or had some trouble getting out of bed.

Finally, I have been waking up at least once to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. This is usually not very annoying since I usually go back to sleep easily. But still, it is something that concerns me because I don't usually do that and wish I could sleep for 8 complete hours without any disturbance.
