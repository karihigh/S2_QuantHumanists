## Quantified Self Intervention
### Slowing down

During the spring break, I had less human interaction that I usually have on a normal school week. Partly because I haven't lived here enough to have a social life outside school and because some of my friends went away for the week. So I stayed with myself and a friend's dog. To balance my lack of social interaction I 'spoke' to friends and family through WhatsApp. But since usually exchange long conversations with them because they are far, I tend to send voice notes, and they too. This week I sent a lot of those.

My sister and I can exchange thousands of words per second and we totally understand each other. But when speaking to other people, specially in english I do my best to slow down so they can get what I'm saying. But my brain goes faster than average, so when I speak at a normal speed I feel like a [whale](https://youtu.be/jJGeeryk0Eo?t=46).

A while ago, someone shared with me a [TV show](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norways-slow-tv-fascinating-viewers-for-hours-or-days-at-a-time/) from a Norwegian national channel which streamed for 8 hours straight the trip from Bergen to Oslo in train. Known for being the most beautiful train rides of the world, they decided to put a camera on the front and stream it live. The rating exceeded all expectations and some time after they filmed a boat's three-day journey through the coast of Norway. They called it "slow TV".

That show led me to other kind of *slow lifestyles* as explained by Wikipedia below:

> Slow living is a lifestyle emphasizing slower approaches to aspects of everyday life. The concept of 'slow' lifestyles started with the slow food movement, which emphasizes more 'traditional' food production processes as a reaction to fast food emerged in Italy during the 1980s and 1990s. Slow food and slow living are frequently, but not always, proposed as solutions to what the green movement describes as problems in materialistic and industrial lifestyles.
