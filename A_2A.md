For this data visualization postcard I decided to register three characteristic sounds of my surroundings. Since I moved here I have been surprised by the amount of sirens I can hear in one day. Whenever I saw a typical United State's movie, sirens are part of the city soundtrack no matter what. In the city that I grew up, this is not something you hear every day. So I thought that it could me interesting to gather the amount of these kind of sounds throughout the week. I selected three distinct sounds that I usually hear: ambulance sirens, car horns, police sirens, motorcycles loud engines, among others. Also I live in neighborhood were cars passing and blasting urban music is a common thing. So I narrowed it to 3 distinct sounds: ambulance sirens, police kind of siren and cars passing by with loud music. I downloaded 'Nomie' app in my phone because it is something I carry always in my pocket and suited the kind of tracking I wanted to do. Count whenever I heard any of these sounds, the time and location.

The first day was very challenging since I wasn't used to track these things down. For my benefit, my Mom is in town and I told her about this assignment. She was unexpectedly attentive to what I was tracking and helped me notice whenever an ambulance passed. I think that since she is not living here, her level of attentiveness was increased while touring around New York. I feel that she was experiencing the same thing that happened to me some months ago when I arrived. But in the time that has passed I started got used to this sounds that initially caught my attention.

I started drawing the first attempts in a restaurant who's mats are a drawable sheet and they provide pencils, very appreciated (see image above). When I imagined the data visually I thought about how sound waves are usually represented. I thought about making each recorded data as a part of a big speaker and its expanding waves.
