### Dear Data
## Loud noises of New York
# As heard by *Karina Hyland*

About: Using "dear data" as a guide, create a set of rules to visualize your data. Think about the ways in which Georgia and Stefanie parameterized the aspects of their records to produce their visualizations. Find ways to express your own personal style and aesthetic in the implementation of your rules.
Submission: Document your process and submit images of your output along with the accompanying description of your visualization.
