For this data visualization postcard I decided to register three characteristic sounds of my surroundings. Since I moved here I have been surprised by the amount of sirens I can hear in one day. Whenever I saw a typical United State's movie, sirens are part of the city soundtrack no matter what. In the city that I grew up, this is not something you hear every day. So I thought that it could me interesting to gather the amount of these kind of sounds throughout the week. I selected three distinct sounds that I usually hear: ambulance sirens, car horns, police sirens, motorcycles loud engines, among others. Also I live in neighborhood were cars passing and blasting urban music is a common thing. So I narrowed it to 3 distinct sounds: ambulance sirens, police kind of siren and cars passing by with loud music. I downloaded 'Nomie' app in my phone because it is something I carry always in my pocket and suited the kind of tracking I wanted to do. Count whenever I heard any of these sounds, the time and location.

The first day was very challenging since I wasn't used to track these things down. For my benefit, my Mom is in town and I told her about this assignment. She was unexpectedly attentive to what I was tracking and helped me notice whenever an ambulance passed. I think that since she is not living here, her level of attentiveness was increased while touring around New York. I feel that she was experiencing the same thing that happened to me some months ago when I arrived. But in the time that has passed I started got used to this sounds that initially caught my attention.

I started drawing the first attempts in a restaurant who's mats are a drawable sheet and they provide pencils, very appreciated (see image above). I did a very simple table to write down the data to have an overview of the amount of data collected. With this, I then imagined how does sound waves are usually represented. I thought about making each recorded data as a part of a big speaker and its expanding waves. Also I tried to draw individual modules of each day using a drawing of a siren. Because it was only a 6 day collection of the data, I felt that the individual modules didn't fill the size of the postcard, so I continued trying the waves.

As I was drawing several attempts of the final one I felt the need to transfer the data from the app to a spreadsheet. Nomie showed me the data only as monthly total or day per day, so it was easier to read it in a Google Sheets, which also gave me a new perspective of the data.

After a few initial drafts, this is the final result.<br>
I drew a grid for each day as a piece of cake in which the a line is drawn according to the time of the day I heard each noise. I assigned a color for each different sound (ambulance = red, police = blue, passing car with loud music = green). To reveal the location of the data, I decided to divide each record into two main zones, Manhattan and Brooklyn. To express this I drew the line either straight or curly to determine where I was when I heard the sound.
