# Personal Reflection

My first approach with self-tracking was also my first experience with data visualization. I took a class in my undergrad in which we had to track something of ourselves. I have always been very reluctant to this kind of excercises because I feel like 'who cares' about my data. But after opening my mind and seeing other works, I found that the ways of representing the data is something people might care. The outcome of the collection and analysis of your personal collection could be very interesting. Also I feel that data tracking is the perfect antagonist of 'big data'. Firstly in terms of scale big data, as the name suggests, usually refers to the billions of numbers generated in our current digitalized world. On the contrary, self-data is tiny. It usaully refers to one person only and that person is the most interested in the outcomes of it. Big data gathers data from thousands of people and it is on the main interest of the biggest companies. 
What also came to my mind while doing some self-tracking excersises is the relationship to our natural mechanisms of tracking, our mental memory. I have started some self tracking excersises like using apps to track my sleep or starting spreadsheets about the food I ate and stomach states to try to find out if I was lactose-intolerant. I used the sleep one mostly because it is suppose to wake you up when you had finished a natural sleep cycle instead of waking you in the middle of one. During that time I felt it worked many mornings that the alarm wasn't bothering at all and I could get out of bed easily. But after a while I started unconsciously to discover how did the app worked. You were supposed to put it under your pillow and the accelerometer on the phone tracked your movements. According to these it was able to predict if you were either deep sleeping, light sleeping or awake. So some mornings that I didn't wanted to wake up, I tried not to move, so that the app thought I was sleeping and it wouldn't wake me up until the last minute of alarm range. Also I started sleeping extra conscious about my sleep and trying to trick the app in some ways. So, I stopped using it.
