# Personal Reflection

My first approach with self-tracking was also my first experience with data visualization. I took a class in my undergrad in which we had to track something of ourselves. I have always been very reluctant to this kind of excercises because I feel like 'who cares' about my data. But after opening my mind and seeing other works, I found that the ways of representing the data is something people might care. The outcome of the collection and analysis of your personal collection could be very interesting. Also I feel that data tracking is the perfect antagonist of 'big data'. Firstly in terms of scale big data, as the name suggests, usually refers to the billions of numbers generated in our current digitalized world. On the contrary, self-data is tiny.
