# Personal Reflection

My first approach with self-tracking was also my first experience with data visualization. I took a class in my undergrad in which we had to track something from ourselves. I have always been very reluctant to this kind of excercises because I feel like 'who cares' about my data. But after opening my mind and seeing other works, I found that the ways of representing the data is something people might care. The outcome of the collection and analysis of your personal results could be very interesting. Also I feel that data tracking is the perfect antagonist of 'big data'. Firstly in terms of scale, big data, as the name suggests, usually refers to the billions of numbers generated in our current digitalized world. On the contrary, self-data is tiny. It usaully refers to one person only and that person is the most interested in the outcomes. Big data gathers data from thousands of people and it is on the main interest of the biggest companies. 

What also came to my mind while doing some self-tracking excersises before is the relationship to our natural mechanisms of tracking, our mental memory. I have started some self tracking excersises like using apps to track my sleep and a spreadsheets about the food I ate and how my stomach felt to try to find out if I was lactose intolerant. I used the sleep one mostly because it is meant to wake you up when you had finished a natural sleep cycle instead of waking you in the middle of one. During that time I felt it worked many mornings that the alarm wasn't bothering at all and I could get out of bed easily. But after a while I started unconsciously to discover how did the app worked. You were supposed to put it under your pillow and the accelerometer on the phone tracked your movements. According to these it was able to predict if you were either deep sleeping, light sleeping or awake. So some mornings that I didn't wanted to wake up, I tried not to move, so that the app thought I was deep sleeping and it wouldn't wake me up until the last minute of the alarm range. Also I started sleeping extra conscious about my sleep and trying to trick the app in some ways. It was making me a little nuts, so I stopped using it. 

In the case of the spreadsheet to write down the kind of food I ate and whether I had symptoms or not, I never collected enough data to actually make any assumptions and ended taking a blood exam to accurately determine if I was lactose intolerant or not. My major trouble with self-data tracking is the struggle with my consciousness to try to not be aware of the tracking so that I can naturally track things without any bias. I decided I wasn't going to try again to track what I ate cause it was making me more anxious about food, instead of actually gathering some useful information. In the other hand, a couple of years ago I got a new phone that had pre-installed the Google Fit app. At the time it was a rather simple app that suggested a daily movement goal (movement of any kind such as walking or biking). Without even noticing I tried to achieve that goal and started choosing to walk instead of taking public transportation whenever I had the time. I only got one notification whenever I had reached that goal and it made me feel good! Withouy actively using the app, the 'not awareness' of it was in this case super useful. 

To conclude, I feel the biggest challenge with self-data tracking is to try to balance the amount of awareness you have when you start this excercise. Using your brain as a benefit rather than an enemy.
